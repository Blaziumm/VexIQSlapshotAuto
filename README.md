We hope that this repoistory is a good basis for some more advanced autonomis programing, and will be used to push the limits of Vexiq, although this repo is made for VIQC, it can still work with some modification with other robotics progams, including, but not limited to, FTC, FRC, and VRC. I hope this project will give you insperation for what you can do with progaming and a little bit of time!

Thanks!
Blazium and Team 21037A
